TODO: Ask khraethor about boss progress

FIXME: Vigil is getting knocked back even when PG'ing an attack with knockback

FIXME:
Demo3 - Wrong Sky texture (rain)
Demo4 - Outdated text stuff
Demo5 - Plays music

Deathmatch: Perfect Guard isn't applying to Vigil properly, sound plays, so does the effect, doesn't apply to the player - Fixed? Needs testing.
Deathmatch: Vigi's Final stab first hit should push player back without a guard break - Needs testing (set first hit to knockback 6)

FIXME: No more "Screen Flash" when slow-mo turns on
FIXME: Improve the gold dropping formula so farming low level monsters for the same gold amount as
	   higher level monsters cannot occur.
	    - Doing it by a 'max gold' drop variable that monsters are given via QuakeC (Changable by mapper)
	    - Re-evaluated, tougher monsters give higher amount of EXP which is tied into how much gold is dropped
	      according to Vigil's level. This means you can grind the same amount of gold at your appropriate level.
FIXME: Every player should have their own combos counted for themselves
FIXME: Remove Vigil's velocity (set to '0 0 0') on dodge rolls, fixing the sliding dodge issue
TODO: Remove relics from Vigil as they are put in place and the world is built
	  - Removed Relics, user can enter relics.bsp to get them back
FIXME: Lower Boss1's Health - he's too powerful for such an early stage of the game
FIXME: Vigil switches directions on a new forward + attack command. Pressing Back + Attack should make you turn around, not keep attacking
in the same direction. These attacks are weaker, thus leaving you more open.
	- Fixed
FIXME: Troglod's animation and other stuff looks hilariously wrong and bad, he also requires better AI.
	- He also leaves the firebeam cone infront of him :\

	- Done.
TODO: Reanimate the Lightning Storm frames, make them more interesting and less lame.
	- Done

-----

FIXME: Vigil's headsmash can become stuck in weird geometry locations concerning slopes
	- Fixed, used test X origin code from swallow attacks to test for test Z on headsmash
FIXME: Add a 3 second limit before Vigil cancels out of the Off-The-Wall Diving Swallow, he can become perma-stuck
	- Maybe a oldorigin test will work, or a before test check if his X (left/right) origin changes.
	- Added code that tests oldorigin, test if this works
	- Fixed by test X origin
FIXME: Final blow of the mid air kicks should send a player flying down with the proper animation in deathmatch

	- Fixed
FIXME: Shorten the final bridge in tower, BY A LOT (Possibly remove outer ledge)
	- Fixed
INVESTIGATE: Vigil cannot be hit by the Hell Knights lightning attack during his charge spin, I doubt it as
he isn't set to invunerable in the gamecode but we'll see.
	- Tested, false bug report.
FIXME: Remove .wav references in music playing code, delete .wav music in PAK file
	- 10 megs reduction :O
	- .wav QuakeC removed
FIXME: Grass is displaying realtime lighting, this can cause framerates to drop dramatically when any realtime
lighting occurs.
	- Fixed, grass is no longer makestatic();

-----

FIXME: Aircombo count is set to 7 by roundhouse kick, change to 9 as it's being shared. Otherwise it hasn't caused
a problem as far as I can see.
	UPDATE: Clops found if you try to follow up with a diving swallow attack in an unconnect spin kick,
	Vigil will switch to the final airkick strike.
	 - FIXED
FIXME: Shorten the spin kick, it hits too far and looks silly
	 - FIXED
FIXME: Dodge attacks can enter weird angles, while in a dodge left go of block and use the arrow keys.
	- Fixed, had to hack it into client.qc as I have no idea what was moving him normally.
	- Fixed, above fixed messed up menu causing arrow keys to stop functioning. Whoops!
TODO: Make Relics look better
	- Added, thanks Chillo
TODO: Blocking manuvers/dodges
	- Added
FIXME: Slopes and dodging act funny, Vigil turns around oddly
	- Fixed.

	- Fixed.
FIXME: Vigil can do manuvers off walls with a wall jump on, looks retarded
	- Fixed.
FIXME: Make the midair combo kicks mashable.
	- Fixed.
FIXME: Solve camera issues, apparently moving the level to 0 horiztonal makes the camera act better
	- Fixed. Thanks FrikaC.
FIXME: A player can hold down jump while wall jumping and Vigil will automatically do the spin slash double
jump technique, it must require a double tap.
	- Fixed. Never test button conditions with timers!
FIXME: Mash keys should also check if the user is pressing forward, also apply it to standing still combo attack
	- Fixed.
FIXME: 3rd standing slice should hit inside Vigil also, recommending using the stabbing attacks collision
	- Fixed.
FIXME: Vigil's spin slash (Double jump) radius is too large, hits people too far downwards
	- Fixed, was 50 now 35.
FIXME: Deathmatch bug where players can move themselves around even in pain frames:
	- Added self.pain_finished, check if it works...
FIXME: Don't allow block control during slowdown time, it's useless and only makes the sound effect which
is weird
	- Fixed.
