<RenegadeC> Vigil: Will do

*Description*
-------------

The Ascension of Vigil is a 3D beat 'em up freeware standalone game using a modified Quake
engine (FTEQuake), it was originally based on Golden Axe at one point however that changed when
I decided to change the scope of the game,.

This game mixes a variety of gameplay elements such as platforming, minor roleplaying
statistics, magic spells, equipment upgrades, relics (ability upgrades), air combos and
so on. This is a work in progress and I hope to see it finished through till it's done.

It can be summed up as a 3D Beat em up RPG platforming adventure fighting exploration game,
yeah - or "Hybrid 3D search action".

3a.
Misc:
----

- Guard breaking -

Some enemies attacks may break Vigil's guard, this is dangerous and leaves Vigil
wide open to an attack as well as pushing Vigil backwards! Be wary of certain enemy
attacks that are more powerful and immediately block again, jump, or move away
quickly!

- Spell Casting -

To select the spell and not cast it, press anything but the magic button again
such as jump, block or attack

You may scroll through different spells with the UP/DOWN keys as long as
the menu is open! NOTE: Which spell you've selected is saved at all times!

- Running -

Running - Double tap which direction you wish to run in and hold it down.

- Wall Grabbing -

Press toward the direction of the wall you wish to grab, only flat walls
may be grabbed! Block will cause Vigil to fall, jump will cause him to jump
off the wall in the other direction (you may also double jump), and attack
will perform Vigils "Diving Swallow" attack!

- Enemy Grabbing -

Vigil is able to grab enemies nearly his size, just simply walk (not run)
into enemies and Vigil will attempt to grab them automatically. NOTE: You
can only grab other players in deathmatch mode if they're blocking! Also
certain monsters cannot be grabbed.

- Ledge Grabbing -

Vigil is able to grab onto ledges and hoist himself up, press the direction of the
ledge to grab it. If this occurs you can either press UP and climb, or press DOWN
to fall! You may block also, however you'll fall.

- Wall Running -

Vigil can run along walls for a short amount of time, simply run and jump towards the
back wall while holding which direction you want Vigil to run it, letting go of that
direction will cause Vigil to stop running along the wall. While wall running you may
also press jump for a quick spin jump which will add speed and height! Vigil is also
able to attack while wall running, simply press attack if an enemy is infront or near
Vigil and he'll perform his "Diving Swallow" attack, with the added benefit of the
attack auto aimed at a suitable enemy!

---------------
*Special Moves*
---------------

press attack 3 times on the ground = "Vigil Stab Special", a basic 6-hit combo can
be mashed for extra hits

While running, press attack = "Destroyer Slash", pushes enemies back far
and deals moderate damage if the full attack connects!

While in air, down and attack = "Head Splitter", a falling high velocity damaging attack
yet it has a slow recovery time when it lands

While in air, press attack 3 times = Vigil "double kick slash" combo, a basic 3-hit
air combo

While Vigil is knocked back, quickly tap jump once and Vigil will backflip and recover

Press jump twice for a double jump, it's best to do it when Vigil reaches the peak of
his jump

After blocking an enemy attack, press attack quickly = "Revenge Slice", this is a
quick counter attack move you can sneak in to slash enemies and it has an added
benefit of pushing them back also

Press attack and jump simultaneously = "Vigil's Total Denial", a spin attack that
damages all enemies around Vigil; it uses up a lot of mana, however the more mana
you possess the stronger the damage. It can also break out of pain animations!

While holding attack down, double/quickly tap forward = "Justice Launch", this
launches opponents straight up into the air with a good bit of damage, this is
Vigil's 'launcher' move for starting air combos.

Hold/press left or right direction and block = "Spin Kick", this is useful for getting
enemies away from you as it kicks them back a far distance and is very quick, it only
deals minor damage though. It may also be used in the air, if done so and the attack
connects then you may follow up with a "flying swallow" attack by pressing attack before
he's finished his spin kick animation; the "flying swallow" is a high damaging move that
pushes enemies very far along with dealing a good amount of damage

While in the air, press/hold up and attack = "Uppercut Barrage", this attack is used
primarily for air combos and has great anti-air properties; it is able to hit an
enemy up to 3 times!

While Wall Grabbing + attack = Vigil "Diving Swallow", Vigil will jump kick through
multiple enemies doing more damage and hits depending on if the enemy was struck in
the air or not; this attack is potentially the most powerful if brought into an air combo
at a high enough height

While wall grabbing press jump = "Wall Jump", Vigil will jump off the wall in the opposite
direction, this is used to climb up verticle tunnels, you are also free to double jump to
climb faster or gain more height and overall distance

While grabbing an enemy, press attack 3 times = Vigil will pummel his opponents up close
ending off with a fancy double round house kick that blows the enemy away and deals a decent
amount of damage. NOTE: You're able to block at any time!

Hold attack while standing still, when Vigil's sword is behind his head then release attack!
This is the "Vol'Brand Mangler" which is a very powerful move and counter-attack.
NOTE: If landing from a jump you're able to release this attack almost instantly

Only *during* a double jump or performing an Uppercut slice you can execute Vigils strongest
melee attack called the "Flaming Head Splitter", simply press DOWN + Attack!

While wall running, press attack = Vigil "Diving Swallow", same move as above however it's
auto aimed which allows Vigil to hit enemies even in the foreground! However it's not always
entirely accurate, and he may even miss completely if he's too high and his target is too low

Try chaining special moves, regular moves and even air combos together for huge damage and
impress your friends!

-----------------------------------------
Game progress / Game Todo / Game updates:
-----------------------------------------

Coding is handled by Tyne / RenegadeC
Most graphics were borrowed or are free for use (with the author credited ofcourse) - I'd
be nice to replace them all but that will delay the mod over a longer period of time from
completion. If you wish to create replacement models for some of the monsters please contact me.

Some sounds are borrowed as well, however most of them from scratch - I hope to replace
all the borrowed sounds.

Mapping/Mappers, this is a problem as there aren't many Quake 1 map makers anymore; especially
ones who are willing to help mods. I'll try to do the level myself and seek help wherever
neccessary!

*Thanks to the following mappers*

RPG - map01 / map02
Pope - popaov, scrapped
Bl1tz - dungeon
DCMad - castle, turned into arena2

6.
----------------------
Readme todo / updates:
----------------------

In no particular order:

* Add spell descriptions
* Add basic combat tactics and descriptions
* Add Mapping info
* Make this into an html file with pictures one day?
* Add multiplayer setup information

expect more in this readme over time..

Credits:
--------

A special thanks to everyone below, without your help who knows how TAoV would turn out?
If I missed you, please inform me!

xaGe - 2nd in command pretty much, provided lots of feedback and help with the overall
project immensely

Chillo for support and ideas, deathmatch testing, and keeping me sane, and his awesome
modeling / texture / skin work / sound effects. Wow he's done a lot. Creator of the Vigil
player model (Old and new!), Merman monster and so forth

Reki - Client-side QuakeC (CSQC) help the for HUD, smoother camera, and a big help for the MenuQC

Wes Desjardins AKA Gridluster - Awesome music tracks that replaced 'borrowed' works

MTrop - Fixed taunt2.wav too much "sssss" on my voice

Sock - Used his book.mdl

Spirit - Sunset skybox used in Wild Lands

Wazat - Helped with the armor pickup code so each player in multiplayer is able to
grab it, a great balancing issue. Armor was removed but his code was then applied to
gold & other pick ups. I also used his HP Bars from his Conquest mod. Miss you dude.

DCMad - He helped with his suggestions on the mod and supported it greatly, also
is the author of the castle level before I hacked/revised it to pieces and then
finally turning it into a deathmatch arena (Arena2.bsp).

Bl1tz for mapping / sound effects / awesome music work, he created all of dungeon.bsp
along with most the original music you hear in this game. He hates lighting his maps,
but I suppose the glass is always half full in others minds.

Authors of rubicon2 (czg/metlslime) for their sparks model and code, I used it for effects
when attacks are blocked.

RPG for helping with graphic decisions / mapping / helping the mod along and being
on the TAoV team originally. He created the first 2 areas of the game. He disappeared.

speeds - Mapping, general support, bug reporting and more

Evilbastard & Mindcrime, they made the Nehahra models that are used within the mod such
as the damned Baron!

Special thanks to Gokuma for helping with the sound from guardian heroes for the spell
charging up; it fits nicely, and thanks Treasure for making the spell charging sfx. This
is a person I communicated with over ICQ, he was awesome. I wish him well, if he's AMOGUS.

LORDHavoc for helping with me code-wise with searchradius(); which replaces findradius();

FrikaC for the frame skipping code to keep things in sync, blacksmiths skin, camera fix
and more. Sensei.

iD software for Quake ofcourse, without them The Ascension of Vigil would not exist!

Haze & jedilamma - New particle scripts that TAoV uses

Spike - FTE Engine which TAoV uses, being a super genius who helps quite a lot with various
coding issues and has great suggestions on tackling problems

dumptruck_ds & Joshua Skelton - Updated and more powerful misc_model functions as well as
some various things/ideas used from progs_dump to move things along

law56ker - Support, suggestions, and reporting bugs

Tomaz for the new font (conchars) replacement that's actually readable and straight
compared to the old one

PeachesTheDemon for his 'tall grass' sprite which replaced my ugly attempt, which was
then replaced with a 3D grass model

Seth Galbraith (sgalbrai@krl.org), I used some of his GPL models but not that many, pretty
talented person! He also invented dithered water for Quake :)

MauveBib - Helped with coding shadows tilting on sloped ground, new vigil skins on the
old poly model, angular slope work, and also helped with the armor pickup code for
multiplayer and multiplayer testing in general

Singe - explode1.mdl, he created it and I barely modified it

BloodShot from Quake 1.5 - Allowed me permission to use his DrawLevelName(); CSQC routine

Preach - Models like horror.mdl / embers / vines / waterfalls / fences

Redfield - A plethora of awesome models such as his raven, bats, bat swarm, various detail model
decorations and more .. all Raven Keep models used were made by him with permission

ericw - His latest vis/light/qbsp tools were used to compile all game levels.

Khurasan - Great Fighter font

Enjoy the game,
